The decision was taken at a meeting of Delhi AAP MLAs called by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at his official residence to review the civic bodies polls result. However, the formal announcement will make after the meeting of party's Political Affairs Committee (PAC), AAP highest decision-making body. Yesterday, AAP's Delhi convener Dilip Pandey had resigned from the post, taking the responsibility of the party's drubbing in the municipal polls. \"Labour Minister Gopal Rai has been appointed as the new convener of Delhi AAP. The formal decision will be announced after the PAC meeting,\" an AAP functionary said. In the meeting, Kejriwal also asked the MLAs to go back to people and introspect the reasons behind the poll debacle. The newly-elected 48 councillors also met the chief minister at his residence. Talking to reporters after the meeting, AAP legislator Vishesh Ravi said, \"In the meeting, it was decided that MLAs will go back to people and try to find out where has been a communication gap between the legislators and them\". Ravi, the MLA from Karol Bagh, said that in the meeting with Kejriwal, the EVM manipulation issue also came up for discussion. \"The AAP will soon decide its future course of action on this issue. At present, related evidence (pertaining to EVM manipulation) is being gathered,\" Ravi said. Another AAP MLA Nitin Tyagi said that in the meeting, it was discussed that MLAs should introspect on what went wrong in the MCD elections. Asked about who will be the next party's Delhi convener, Tyagi also said Rai may be appointed to the post. \"We need to work at the ground level in our constituencies and also introspect on what went wrong in MCD polls. I think there has been a communication gap between MLAs and people. We could not convince the people about the good work done by the Delhi government. \"I think people also forgot how the BJP in the MCD had failed for the last 10 years,\" Tyagi, the MLA from Laxmi Nagar, said. Another AAP lawmaker, who did not wish to be named, said that Kejriwal has asked all party legislators to not be upset with the MCD poll results and go back to people.

Soon after the encounter, a mob started pelting stones at the security forces, leading to a clash in which a 75-year-old civilian was killed due to a bullet injury. At around 4am, three terrorists, dressed in black Pathani suit and combat jackets, entered from the rear side the artillery unit of the army garrison at Panzgam in Kupwara, about 100 kms from here, and started indiscriminate firing, army officials said here and in New Delhi. They managed to cross the second security layer of the camp located in a mountainous terrain and spread over an area of 400 x 800 meters, the officials said. Firing indiscriminately, the terrorists then advanced towards the officers' complex of the camp which houses about 1000 army personnel and is situated about 10 kms from the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan. Soldiers took on the attackers and forced them back towards one of the gates of the camp, the officials said. In the gunfight, Captain Ayush Yadav, Subedar Bhoop Singh Gujjar and Naik B Venkata Ramanna were killed. Five other soldiers were injured and they were airlifted to Army's 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar. The terrorists started fleeing as the Quick Response Team (QRT) of the army swung into action, the officials said. Two terrorists were gunned down while a third one managed to escape under the cover of darkness, the officials said. \"The entire operation lasted 35 minutes,\" said Col Saurabh in Kupwara. The troops recovered three AK rifles which indicated that there was a third terrorist, he said, adding search operations are underway to track him down. \"We have recovered three AK rifles, nine magazines, 156 AK rounds, one Chinese pistol, three UBGL grenades, three hand grenades, two radio sets, two GPS devices and a smartphone from the slain terrorists,\" another official said. The official, on the condition of anonymity, said the attackers seemed to be foreigners but their identity was being ascertained. As soon as the encounter ended, local residents held protest demonstrations, demanding that the bodies of slain terrorists be handed over to them for performing their last rites, a police official said. The protestors, including women and elderly, continued demonstrations but the army personnel did not relent to their demand, the official said. In the clash between stone-pelting mobs and security forces, one Mohammad Yousuf Bhat sustained a bullet injury in his chest and was rushed to Kupwara hospital where doctors declared him 'brought dead'. Locals alleged that he was killed in firing by security forces. Capt Yadav, who hailed from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, had joined the service some three years ago. Naik Ramana (38) hailed from Visakhapatnam and served in the army for the last 18 years while Subedar Gujjar (46) had put in 26 years of service.

Here's why", "body": "Arguably, Baahubali: The Conclusion is the biggest film event this year. When Baahubali: The Beginning released in 2015, it had little expectations among the audience. But it became a terrific hit is a different issue. The success of the first part mainly lies in the climax hook, that paved the way for the sequel. Barring its story, Rajamouli's characters had evoked certain emotions on the audience. For the same, Baahubali 1 went to become the highest grossing film that year and netted Rs 650 crore. As the world awaits the release of Baahubali: The Conclusion, let's delve deeper into its box-office figures. Baahubali 2 is released across in a massive 6,500 screens in India. Cumulatively, the epic sequel is releasing in over 9000 screens worldwide, which is huge for an Indian film. Earlier this week, the film received fantastic response in advance booking sales in India and most of the tickets were sold out for the first weekend. To be precise, ticket booking site BookMyShow announced that it has already sold over a million tickets in just over 24 hours for Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. Baahubali 2 witnessed unprecedented craze down South. In terms of advance sales revenue, the SS Rajamouli's film has surpassed the Bollywood blockbuster Dangal, which had Aamir Khan in the lead. Speaking about the film, Ashish Saksena, COO of BookMyShow, said, \"BookMyShow is experiencing an unprecedented advance booking for Baahubali 2. We have already sold over 1 million tickets across languages, even when the bookings have been live for just over a day. Though Baahubali 2 is largely perceived to be loved by South Indian audience, the response from Hindi speaking markets has been highly encouraging as well. Once all the cinemas in South come out with their schedules for the film, we expect the online ticket sales for Baahubali 2 to surge at an increasingly fast pace. \"According to trade pundits, Baahubali 2 is set to have a phenomenal opening at the box office and the numbers are expected somewhere between Rs 90-100 crore on the first day itself. Recently, the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana state government have given special permission to screen Baahubali 2. In AP, the film will have six shows a day, while Telangana will have five shows. Produced by Arka Mediaworks, the sequel is made on a budget of Rs 250 crore and has already fetched enough moolah for the producers even before the release. Reports also suggest that Baahubali 2 raked in Rs 500 crore through its satellite and distribution rights. Collectively put together all the factors, Baahubali 2 is expected to shatter box-office records and is very likely to emerge as the first Indian film to earn Rs 1000 crore. Directed by SS Rajamouli, Baahubali 2 takes the story forward from where Baahubali: The Beginning ended. Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah, Sathyaraj and Ramya Krishnan star in pivotal roles in this instalment of Baahubali too.
