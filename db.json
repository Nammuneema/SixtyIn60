He was fielded by the party from Gorakhpur, which has only sent the BJP's Yogi Adityanath to parliament since 1998. Mr Tiwari stood no chance. Cut to 2017. On Wednesday, as the BJP retained three municipal corporations in an election that had attained mega proportions, Manoj Tiwari, 46, took centrestage. As the BJP's Delhi chief, he gets credit for steering the party on ground to a commanding win, though all leaders, including the actor-turned-politician, have acknowledged that it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity that won the party a third term despite allegations of poor handling of Delhi's civic affairs. The BJP had won, Mr Tiwari said, because of PM Modi's policies and the leadership of party chief Amit Shah. \"This is a victory of Delhi's people who believe that the BJP will work for their happiness and welfare,\" he said on Wednesday in his victory speech. MCD Elections 2017: The BJP celebrated a huge win in Delhi civic polls yesterday. The BJP has won 181 out of the total 272 seats in the three corporations, dealing a severe blow to the hope of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party of consolidating its position in Delhi and to the Congress, which had hoped for a political revival in the capital. Mr Tiwari's political standing gets a significant leg-up. He was handed charge of the Delhi unit only six months ago and tasked with ensuring that an anti-incumbency sentiment did not trip the party after controlling the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for 10 years. He was appointed with an eye on the capital's significant number of Poorvanchali voters, from eastern UP and Bihar. The BJP reckoned that the Poorvanchali voters, seen as the prime driver behind Arvind Kejriwal's sweep of Delhi in the assembly elections, would connect with the Bhojpuri actor-singer. MCD Elections 2017: Manoj Tiwari helped the BJP win the support of Poorvanchali voters. Manoj Tiwari, who is also the BJP member of Parliament from northeast Delhi, swiftly got down to the task, launching overnight stays in slums, unauthorised colonies and semi-urban parts of the city to interact with voters. In an intense campaign, he covered almost 250 of the 272 wards in the three corporations, Mr Tiwari switched with ease from Hindi to Bhojpuri and crooned his hit songs in areas dominated by Poorvanchali voters. He also reportedly composed some of the radio jingles that the BJP used extensively in its campaign for the MCD elections. Manoj Tiwari would've made vote appeals alongside once-rival Yogi Adityanath, but the plan to rope in the new Uttar Pradesh chief minister for the Delhi civic polls campaign did not come about.

Read | Kupwara army camp attack LIVE: Three soldiers killed in Kashmir, militants used guns and grenadesThe attackers, suspected to be fidayeen militants, sneaked into the camp before sunrise at around 4. Sources said the group of four militants are believed to have had crossed over from Pakistan. The the Associated Press quoted army spokesperson colonel Rajesh Kalia as saying that the militants used guns and grenades to target soldiers northwest of Srinagar. The army cordoned off the entire area including a nearby forest area as bodies of only two militants have been retrieved so far. The attack is suspected to have been carried out by the Pakistan-based outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad. However, there was no independent confirmation of the incident and no rebel group has issued any statement so far. The attack came amid heightened tension across the valley since April 9, when eight people including seven students were killed by police and paramilitary forces during by-polls to the Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency. The incident will also likely to further strain the already frayed India\u2019s relations with Pakistan, whom New Delhi accuses of sheltering and supporting militant outfits targeting security personnel in Kashmir. Last year, India carried out surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and took out several militant launch pads. Pakistan, however, denies any Indian strike on its territiory. The strikes followed a string of attacks on defence installions and army camps including one at Uri which had left 19 Indian soldiers dead in September last year. Weeks later, seven soldiers, including two majors, were killed when militants dressed as policemen stormed another military camp in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Nagrota. On Wednesday, the Jammu and Kashmir government ordered internet service providers to block Facebook, Twitter and 20 other social media sites and online applications for one month \u201cin the interest of maintenance of public order\u201d. The move came after after several videos and photos depicting alleged abuses of Kashmiris by Indian security forces sparked outrage and fueled protests. Students across Kashmir have been rallying this month at anti-India demonstrations, facing off against heavily armed riot police and paramilitary soldiers.

With this, the stated aim of the NDA government to enable anyone wearing a hawai chappal to be able to board a hawai jahaj is being realized as fares are capped at Rs 2,500 per hour of flying on these select routes. Simultaneously, Modi will also flag off the inaugural UDAN flights on Kadapa \u2013 Hyderabad and Nanded-Hyderabad sectors. The UDAN scheme is important from the air connectivity point of view \u2013 its stated aim is to get the aam aadmi to fly and in doing this, to get unserved and underserved airports to become better utilized. Take the case of the Shimla flight, which will be operated five days a week by Air India subsidiary Allaince Air. It will offer 35 seats on the Delhi-Shimla leg and only 15 on the return journey due to restrictions at Shimla airport though the aircraft is a 48-seater ATR, an Air India spokesperson told Firstpost. Of the 25 seats on the Delhi-Shimla leg, 24 will be priced at a flat Rs 2,036. Which means, if you buy the ticket early enough, flying to and from Shimla will cut the travel time significantly besides costing you a little more than a train journey. It anyway cuts the travel time and the hassle of alighting at Kalka station and then looking for an alternate mode of transport to Shimla. Remember, train facility is only till Kalka from Delhi and from there one has to either book a seat on the toy train or go by road. This morning, a one-way executive class fare on Kalka-Shatabdi for 1 May from New Delhi on the IRCTC website was Rs 1,265. From Kalka, Shivalik Delux to Shimla showed up as another Rs 415. Narendra Modi. PTIThe Delhi-Shimla flight also marks the restarting of operations at the Shimla airport, which has been an unserved airport since 2012 when operating airlines withdrew, citing non-viability. So why is Air India now re-launching operations to Shimla, knowing the skewed route economics? Under the new UDAN scheme, the state government and the centre are committed to providing subsidy as per a pre-decided formula which will perhaps help Air India not book interminable losses on this sector. The economics of this flight make for interesting reading. The Air India spokesperson said that the subsidy amount for this flight is Rs 3,340 per seat. He also explained that only 35 of the 48 seats on this ATR aircraft can by filled on the Delhi-Shimla leg due to airport restrictions whereas on the return journey, only 15 seats can be filled. What is evident from this is that 11 seats on the Delhi-Shimla leg will be priced much higher than the flat Rs 2036 fare for the first 24 seats. Some news reports have suggested that the price for these 11 seats could go up to Rs 20,000 since they will not be covered under the subsidy math, but the spokesperson did not confirm this. On the Shimla-Delhi leg, he said each seat will be priced at Rs 2036. UDAN is a first-of-its-kind scheme globally to stimulate regional connectivity through a market-based mechanism. Under this scheme, routes and networks were awarded to bidders who submitted valid proposals and quoted the lowest viability gap funding (VGF) from the government for such routes and network. The Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency, issued Letter of Awards for 27 such earlier this year. The UDAN scheme will connect 27 currently served airports, 12 underserved airports (which do not service a flight a day presently) and 31 unserved airports (which do not handle a single flight). Under UDAN, the largest number of airports served at 24 will be in the western region; 17 in north, 11 in south, 12 in east and 6 in north-eastern regions. As of now, the government has awarded 16 proposals are for single routes (connecting two cities) and 11 for networks (connecting three or more cities). Six proposals have been bid with zero viability gap funding (VGF), which means on these routes no subsidy amount would be given. So on a net outflow of 200 crore as VGF, 6. 5 lakh subsidized seats would be offered by participating airlines on routes which were otherwise lying unused or were rarely connected. After the first round of bidding for routes under the UDAN scheme was concluded last month, Air Odisha Aviation emerged as the airline connecting the maximum number of unserved airports in India - it proposes to connect 14 such airports which do not service even a single flight as of now. Some of the unserved airports which could again see flights under UDAN include Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jamshedpur, Jalgaon, Akola, Kandla, Puducherry, Bhatinda, Cooch Behar and Bilaspur besides Shimla. The UDAN scheme offers subsidy for 50 percent of the seats on these routes, exclusive route monopoly for three years and a host of other concessions at the landing airports. In turn, it expects the airlines to cap fares at Rs 2,500 per seat per hour rate on regional flights. Alliance Air CEO C S Subbiah had said earlier he expected breakeven on each such ATR-72 flight in a month as 60-70 per cent load factor (which denotes percentage of occupied seats) should be enough for the airline to recover costs. Air Odisha CEO Sanjay Arya had said would take about three months for his 18-20 seater aircraft to break even on the regional routes. After the first round of bidding \u2013 airlines had to bid for the viability gap funding or subsidy they need for each route \u2013 five airlines qualified. These include Air India subsidiary Alliance Air, Air Odisha, Turbo Megha Airways, Air Deccan and SpiceJet. So the big boys of aviation not only stayed away from the first round of bidding, they are also waging a battle against a levy on metro flights which is being used to fund such regional connectivity. IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoAir and Jet Airways have gone to court against the levy imposed by the government on each flight taking off from a metro airport, and some of these airlines have yet not paid the sum accrued from this levy. Civil Aviation Secretary R N Choubey had said earlier the levy actually works out to just Rs 50 per metro passenger and should not be hard to bear. Besides the reluctance of the big domestic airlines to mount flights on these routes, among those airlines that have come forward some have a previous history in the industry which is not all praiseworthy. It remains to be seen if other than Air India and its subsidiaries, many new comers in the UDAN scheme are able to make ends meet despite the subsidy and a host of concessions at landing airports.

According to government sources, the CRPF and other forces have been asked to demoralise the Naxalites by targeting their leaders, area commanders and influential members of the 'jan militia'. There are about 200-250 leaders of different committees and area commanders of Naxalites in Bastar who keep travelling to Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra for coordination as well as to plan attacks on security forces, sources said. There are an estimated 4,000 armed Naxalite cadres in the Bastar belt, aided by a 10,000-12000-strong 'jan militia'. \"A large number of Naxalites have been arrested since last year, but senior leaders (of the insurgents) who plan ambushes on security forces have been eluding the forces for a long time. There is a need to arrest or eliminate them,\" said a government official. \"Home minister Rajnath Singh has already told the forces to go on an all-out offensive and break the Maoists' dominance in Bastar region, for which the government is ready to provide any number of extra companies (of security forces) and modern technology. . . It is important to pick these 250 leaders, and important members in the jan militia using robust intelligence,\" the official added. The forces attributed Monday's attack to not just a lack of human intelligence as around 400 Maoists stationed themselves at the attack site in Burkapal village, but also to the presence of few \"eyes in the air\", or unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). Sources said the CRPF and other forces have just two UAVs for the 10,470sqkm area of Bastar, considered the epicentre of Naxalite violence. The two UAVs, operated from Bhilai under the direction of the National Technical Research Organisation, cannot be deployed for every troop movement, and operations are undertaken on the basis of human intelligence, which turns out to be wrong at times. Both the CRPF and the Chhattisgarh government have informed the home ministry that they need a large number of UAVs to help gather \"real time intelligence\" about the movement of large contingents of Maoists inside the jungle, said sources. The home minister agreed, and has sought a detailed proposal. In addition, there are also plans to procure foliage-penetrating (FOPEN) radar and more Dhruv helicopters to monitor the movement and activities of Naxalites inside thick forests. The issue of sprucing up intelligence in Naxalism-affected areas was also discussed on Wednesday at a meeting the home minister held with NSA Ajit Doval and IB chief Rajiv Jain.

The law to set up a Lokpal was passed in parliament in 2013 - after a massively popular campaign led by activist Anna Hazare that included Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan - and enacted a year later. Last month, the government told the court that the Lokpal cannot be appointed for now as important changes to a committee that is to select its members have yet to be cleared by parliament. The changes involve redefining the \"Leader of Opposition\" post to enable the leader of the largest opposition group in the Lok Sabha to be a part of the Lokpal selection panel. This was needed after the Congress failed to win enough seats in the 2014 national election to qualify for the post of Leader of Opposition. The change has to be cleared in parliament, the government argued. \"The judiciary must respect separation of powers and can't direct parliament to pass amendments. It is the wisdom of the parliament to pass it,\" the government's top lawyer Mukul Rohatgi said. After the BJP came to power in 2014, the government said the leader of opposition's place in the Lokpal selection committee would stay vacant. The government later made a concession and decided to include the largest opposition party in selection panels not just for the Lokpal but also for CBI chief, the Information Commission and the Vigilance Commission. The Congress has been cleared to participate in all but the Lokpal panel. Other members of the Lokpal selection panel are the Prime Minister, the Lok Sabha Speaker, the Chief Justice of India or a Supreme Court judge, and an eminent jurist. A group of NGOs and activists have asked the court to step in saying it has been three years since the Lokpal law was passed but the ombudsman has not been appointed. Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan has questioned the delay. \"The formation committee would hold PM, Speaker. . . and they said that they have not yet declared the leader of Opposition. . .

Ebar Bangla means this time Bengal. In his first address in Kolkata after 2016 assembly election, Shah made an elaborate presentation of the economic package given to the West Bengal government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's regime. He made a strong case against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's persistent complaint of economic deprivation by the Centre. While the Left Front government left a loan burden of Rs 1. 92 lakh crore after 34 years of its rule, under Banerjee's dispensation the burden has shot up to a whopping Rs 3. 50 lakh crore in six years, Shah said. He said from the 13th finance commission that marked the end of UPA II, Bengal got Rs 103,539 crore while the 14th finance commission under Narendra Modi's government allotted the state nearly triple the amount to Rs 2,89,942 crore. \"However, the central funds do not reach people as Mamata Banerjee's government does not allow that to happen. After Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa, our aim is to rule Bengal. Ebar Bangla. Ab Ki Baar Bhajapa Sarkar in Bangla,\" said Shah. West Bengal used to contribute at least 25% share in India's growth that has now reached a nadir with around 4%. Bengal's share in bank deposits was 18% earlier and that has slipped to 12. 8% during the Left regime and under Mamata, it has touched all time low with 6. 3%. Similarly, the bank credit for Bengal is around 5% against the national average of 9. 86%. \"One can have an idea about industry by looking at electricity consumption here. The all India average for the electricity consumption per individual is 957 units, while Bengal is at least 30% lesser with an average of 609 units. Every fifth person here lives under below poverty line. The state has been doing consistently bad in agriculture and labour intensive sectors,\" Shah said. Bengal attracts less than 2% of FDI. \"Mamata Banerjee's government received Rs 34,732 crore in form of grant in aid in 14th finance commission. The revenue deficit grant given by the UPA to Bengal was nil. However, NDA has given them Rs 11760 crore in terms of revenue deficit grant. The state disaster grant has been increased to Rs 2,140 crore by us from Rs 1,263 crore given by UPA. We have also increased the local bodies grant to Rs 20832 crore from Rs 1444 crore,\" said Shah. In addition, the Centre has given Rs 3745 crore for Grameen Rozgar yojana to 51 lakh beneficiaries, Rs 2363 crore for 8. 8 lakh Ghar Nirman and Rs 1209 crore for 2322 Sadak Nirman, Rs 4262 crore under Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana and Rs 1075 crore for other electricity projects, added Shah. With the figures, Shah challenged Banerjee to counter him since he has given the list of 'Ana and Paisa'. Shah said Banerjee's party wears a disguise of 'simplicity' and but is 'scam-ridden' from the inside. Asked about communal tension that increased in Bengal, BJP president felt that it was largely due to the policies of appeasement of Musims by the Banerjee government. Appeasement, according to Shah, has created a volatile communal situation in Bengal. \"I do not make false claims. We do not make false promises to win elections. I challenge them to compare the figures of infant mortality in Bengal and Gujarat,\" Banerjee hit back. \"We have an agriculture growth of 6% in comparison with India's average of 1. 1%. We have a share of 13. 99% in service sector, while India's average is 9%. And in Bengal, industry growth is around 10% while the country's average is around 7%,\" she added. \"Instead of working for the people, BJP is running a malicious propaganda campaign on social media. BJP is jealous of development in non-BJP ruled states. That is why they are depriving Bengal of funds,\" Banerjee told the media persons after her administrative meeting in Alipurduar in North Bengal.

Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had said the Lokpal cannot be appointed in the current scenario as amendments regarding the definition of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lokpal Act was pending in Parliament.

After winning the toss and electing to bowl first, KKR first restricted Rising Pune Supergiant to 182 for five and then chased down the target with seven wickets in hand. \"I thought we are a good chasing side and we are confident of chasing anything. Restricting the opposition to 180 was terrific and the credit needs to go to the bowlers,\" said Gambhir after registering their sixth win out of eight games in this IPL. KKR's chase was built on the 158-run second wicket stand between Robin Uthappa (87 off 47 balls) and Gambhir (62 off 46 balls). \"It's good to keep contributing, I keep saying Orange Cap does not matter if you don't have points as a team. But it is good to score runs and when you are, score as much as you can,\" the KKR skipper said. Uthappa, who was named man-of-the-match for his blistering knock, said he has lot of belief in his own abilities. \"I've always been strong. I have a lot faith in what I'm doing. I'm really confident and I'm enjoying myself out there,\" he said. \"I am enjoying my keeping, I think MS (Dhoni) has set the benchmark for Indian keepers, so I'm slowly but surely getting there. \"The win propelled KKR to the top of the table and Uthappa stressed on the need to keep the momentum going. \"It is very important to respect the momentum we have created for ourselves. Teams tend to fall off in the second half of the tournament,\" he said. Rising Pune Supergiant captain Steven Smith said dew played a role while they were defending the target. \"I thought at the halfway point that it was quite a good total. The wicket was slow, but the dew came on in the chase. \"The wicket just sped up and became very good to bat on. The guys were able to hit through the line comfortably. Gautam (Gambhir) and Robin (Uthappa) batted beautifully,\" Smith said. He also stressed on the need to work on their fielding, which according to him has been letting the team down. \"We put down a few catches and it proved costly, we need to work on our fielding.

New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal calls meeting of all AAP lawmakers AAP lost the civic election in Delhi yesterday Many resignations in AAP over election defeats Arvind Kejriwal, whose Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) appears to be struggling with an all-time low in popularity ratings, has called all his lawmakers home for a meeting a day after the party's latest election loss. AAP has lost the Municipal Corporation of Delhi election held on Sunday, with the BJP retaining its grip on the civic body with a huge majority. There have been a rash of resignations in AAP since then; Dilip Pandey has quit as Delhi in-charge and Sanjay Singh has resigned as the Punjab convenor, three months after the party lost in the state. Alka Lamba, an import from the Congress, has offered to quit as Delhi legislator. This has added to the party's string of poll losses this year just two years after it won a spectacular mandate to rule Delhi and stunned seasoned rivals. Last month, after AAP lost its debut elections in Punjab and Goa, Mr Kejriwal and other leaders of the party blamed it on faulty EVMs or Electronic Voting Machines. MCD Elections 2017 Results: The AAP office bore a deserted look on Wednesday. That has been a recurring theme for the party since then, but after yesterday's defeat, many leaders have questioned that line. Bhagwant Mann, one of AAP's most prominent faces, has accused the leadership of \"behaving like a mohalla cricket team\" and making a \"historic blunder\" in Punjab. He said yesterday that the party should look within, instead of blaming EVMs. The civic poll results indicate that since the 2015 Delhi election, AAP's vote share in the capital has dropped by almost half from 54 per cent to around 26. Some 40 AAP candidates lost their deposit. In the assembly election, AAP won 67 of Delhi's 70 seats, leaving only three for its nearest rival, the BJP. MCD Elections 2017: The BJP celebrated a huge win in Delhi civic polls yesterday. Weeks ago, the party lost one of those seats to the BJP in a by-election, so badly in fact, that its candidate even lost the security deposit. AAP's critics called the loss a precursor of its MCD election defeat. Mr Kejriwal's meeting today comes in the middle of worries that the party is losing its members to defections. Two leaders had crossed over to the BJP during the civic poll campaign. The Chief Minister had alleged recently that his MLAs were being contacted and attempts are being made to draw them away. AAP confronts another potential crisis next month when the Election Commission is likely to decide on a complaint seeking the disqualification of 21 of its lawmakers for allegedly violating \"office of profit\" rules. If nearly a third of AAP's lawmakers are disqualified, the party faces by-elections that it could find tough to win.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is backed in the country's six-year civil war by Russia, Iran and regional Shi'ite militias including Hezbollah, which is a close ally of Tehran and a sworn enemy of Israel. Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz, speaking from the United States, where he has been meeting U. S. officials, to Israeli Army Radio: \"I can confirm that the incident in Syria corresponds completely with Israel's policy to act to prevent Iran's smuggling of advanced weapons via Syria to Hezbollah in Iran. Naturally, I don't want to elaborate on this. \"\"The prime minister has said that whenever we receive intelligence that indicated an intention to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah, we will act. \"An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment. Two senior rebel sources operating in the Damascus area cited their monitors in the eastern outskirts of the Syrian capital, where the airport is located, as saying five strikes had hit an ammunition depot used by Iran-backed militias. Lebanon's al-Manar television, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, said early indications were that the strikes hit warehouses and fuel tanks and had caused only material damage and no human casualties. Israeli officials have previously said they view any movement of advanced weaponry to Hezbollah units in Syria as a \"red line\" that would prompt it to carry out air strikes or artillery fire in the past. A senior regional intelligence source who requested anonymity said the targeted depot handles a significant volume of weapons sent by air Iran, a leading ally of Assad in the region. The source said many of the arms are destined for an array of Iran-backed militias, led by Hezbollah, which have thousands of fighters engaged in some of the toughest fronts against Syrian rebels. Pro-Syrian government media and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights early on Thursday reported a large blast near the airport and a resident of central Damascus, several kilometres (miles) away said it woke her from sleep. The rebel sources said the attack caused a fire with flames appearing to come from a closed military area of the sprawling complex they believed was used by Tehran to supply weapons to Iranian-backed militias operating alongside the Syrian army.

It also plans to enhance connectivity with more airports in the country. The first regional flight under the Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) scheme was flagged off between Shimla and Delhi from Jubbarhatti, the tabletop airport located 2,196 metres above sea level and 22 km from here. During his day-long visit to the Queen of Hills, which saw mild showers in the morning, Modi underscored the thrust on keeping the air fares within the reach of the middle class. \"My dream was to see a person who wears a 'hawai chappal' to fly on the 'hawai jahaz' or plane,\" he said in his almost 20-minute address in Hindi. Air India subsidiary Alliance Air, which will operate the Delhi-Shimla flight, has put the fare at Rs 2,036. He said the UDAN scheme caters to the aspirations of the people of India, making flights cheaper than taxi fare. \"The lives of the middle class are being transformed and their aspirations are increasing. Earlier, aviation was considered to be the domain of a select few. That has changed now,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister foresees tier-II and tier-III cities as \"growth engines\" with the country's aviation sector filled with opportunities. \"If aviation connectivity in tier-II and tier-III cities is enhanced in these places, it will be beneficial,\" he said. \"We had the opportunity to frame a civil aviation policy, which caters to the aspirations of the people of India. \"The UDAN scheme is going to help the tourism sector in Himachal Pradesh,\" Modi said. Accompanied by Himachal Governor Acharya Devvrat, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and Union Ministers P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Jayant Sinha and J. P. Nadda, Modi simultaneously flagged off the inaugural UDAN flights on the Kadapa-Hyderabad and Nanded-Hyderabad sectors through video conferencing. The Shimla airport had been shut for scheduled flights since September 6, 2012, affecting tourists and business travellers. Air India subsidiary Alliance Air will operate the Delhi-Shimla flight. The seating capacity of the airlines under the UDAN scheme will range from 19 to 78. Fifty per cent of the seats in every flight will have a fare cap of Rs 2,500 per hour. The airline companies chosen are Airline Allied Services (Alliance Air), SpiceJet, Turbo Megha Airways, Air Deccan and Air Odisha. The operations under the scheme are intended to provide air connectivity to unserved and remote routes, with airfare capped at Rs 2,500 for an hour's journey of around 500 km, the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement. The scheme caps airfare for an hour-long journey of approximately 500 km on a fixed wing aircraft or for 30 minute journey on a helicopter at Rs 2,500. The UDAN Scheme is a key component of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) which was released on June 15 last year. On March 30, the central government awarded contracts to five companies to operate flights on 128 routes that will connect 70 airports. This was Modi's third visit to Himachal Pradesh and the first to the state capital since he became the Prime Minister in 2014.

Opposition parties like the DMK, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), Congress and CPM have claimed the BJP is using Dinakaran as a pawn to rake chaos in Tamil Nadu corridors of power. \"It is the BJP's doing, as they are trying to take control of AIADMK and gain a footprint in Tamil Nadu\", said G Ramakrishnan, state president of CPM. WHY DINAKARAN'S ARREST WAS IMPORTANTThe arrest of TTV Dinakaran definitely changed the course of Tamil Nadu politics and paved way for the rebellious O Panneerselvam to merge with Sasikala faction. The only possibility for this to happen was the absence of TTV Dinakaran in Chennai who was appointed as Deputy General Secretary of AIADMK by VK Sasikala before her imprisonment at Bengaluru's Parapanna Agrahara jail. Reports about Panneerselvam getting support from the BJP has been doing the rounds ever since the former CM's sudden revolt against Sasikala days after Jayalalithaa's death. According to sources, the only incriminating evidence against Dinakaran is an audio clip of a conversation between middle man Sukesh Chandra and a hawala agent. DINAKARAN - OPS'S BHISMA PITAMAHDinakaran, is an experienced politician and was once considered as the 'Bhishma Pitamah' for O Panneerselvam. He was the one who brought Panneerselvam into limelight. Dinakaran proved his mettle by holding the party together even after his aunt's imprisonment and conducted a successful campaign at RK Nagar. Word is that his canvassing was so comprehensice that he would have easily won the constituency had the Election Commission not cancelled the election. However, the Election Commission cancelled the RK Nagar elections, saying it has preliminary incriminating documents that money was distributed for votes. The fact is that, the Income Tax department claimed that a set of documents were recovered at minister Vijayabhaskar's house which carried names of Chief Minister Edapadi K Palanisami, Electricity Minister Thangamani, Finance Minister Jayakumar and Municipal and Corporations Ministers SP Velumani and also that Rs 89 crore were given to them. None of these men were questioned except for Vijayabhaskar. Dinakaran even then claimed that he'll face the issue legally and left for Bangalore to meet Sasikala, within that fortnight, the other ministers held a meeting and announced that they are ready for a merger with the OPS camp. DELHI POLICE USED AS PAWN?Last week, Delhi Police announced that it has arrested one Sukesh Chandra who was the middleman in Dinakaran's deal with some Election Commission officials to buy AIADMK's two leaves symbol. Interestingly, Sukesh claimed that he never knew who Dinakaran was. \" I have been made a scapegoat, they are implicating me for the past things,\" Sukesh said as he was taken to the court. Delhi Police summoned TTV Dinakaran after naming him as a 'suspected accused'. Subsequently, he was brought to Delhi and arrested after two days of interrogation. EVIDENCE AGAINST DINAKARANThe incriminating evidence of an audio clip between TTV and Sukesh Chandra seems to be hypothetical. A court source claimed that Delhi Police only have an audio clip of a conversation between Sukesh Chandra and a Hawala agent. \"Now as another move they are going to take him on a 'vacation' to Chennai, Bangalore and Kochi. Imagine this, the accused says that he's innocent and yet they are taking him on a trip to find out the money trail. Can it get anymore crazier,\" laughed a former police official who requested anonymity. So the big question is why Delhi Police is indulging in such an investigation? Is it trying to fight corruption or is it being used by someone as a muscle force?WATCH: Dinakaran arrest: From Mannargudi to Poes Garden to prisonALSO READ:AIADMK symbol row: Dinakaran taken to Chennai for further investigationTTV Dinakaran confesses to meeting middleman in EC bribery case, assumed he was high court judgeFor AIADMK's Dinakaran, is it the end of road or just another master plan?", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/dhinakaran-story_647_042017063425_042717022424.jpg", "source": "BJP using Delhi Police to take control of AIADMK, claim Tamil Nadu opposition parties", "link": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ttv-dinakaran-aiadmk-two-leaves-bribery-case-election-commission-delhi-police/1/939651.html", "date": "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 08:57:34 GMT", "category": "Top Stories"}, "19": {"id": "baa247aab38fa0eaea39744c7be1d025", "title": "2550 Crores By Cheque, No Bouncing, Top Court Warns Sahara's Subrata Roy", "body": "New Delhi: Subrata Roy, the 68-year-old chief of the Sahara conglomerate will have to return to jail if he does not deposit about 2,052 crores with the Supreme Court by July 15.

The Supreme Court is looking to ensure that Sahara repays thousands of crores to investors that were collected through a savings deposit scheme that was declared illegal by market regulator SEBI. Sahara has been told to refund a principal amount of 24,000 crores. It has paid about 12,000 crores, while missing a series of deadlines for the balance. The court has been insisting that it urgently provide 5,000 crores - of which about half must now be provided by mid-June. Mr Roy's lawyer, former minister Kapil Sibal, argued against the court's decision at the last hearing to auction Sahara's lavish Aamby Valley township near Lonavala in Maharashtra.

The matter has been simply adjourned to May 9. \"Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. AFPDesai's stand was contradicted by petitioner's counsel Rahul Choudhary who said the bench has issued notice to the AOL founder and sought his reply by 9 May. During the hearing, the bench also pulled up petitioner Manoj Misra over his plea, asking him \"how this has come in the press before coming to us. \"Misra has sought action against Ravi Shankar alleging that his remarks on social media had interfered with free and fair dispensation of justice. AOL's World Cultural Festival was held on the Yamuna floodplains from 11-13 March, 2016, to celebrate 35 years of its service. In a statement published on the AOL's website, Ravi Shankar had blamed the government and the NGT for permitting AOL to hold the function and said his foundation had obtained all necessary permissions, including from the green panel, and the event could have been stopped in the beginning itself if the river was so \"fragile and pure\". In a Facebook post, Ravi Shankar had said, \"If, at all, any fine has to be levied, it should be levied on the Central and state governments and the NGT itself, for giving the permission. If the Yamuna was so fragile and pure, they should have stopped the World Culture Festival\". In the plea filed through advocates Ritwick Dutta and Rahul Choudhary, Misra had said the AOL head's statements \"denigrated the dignity and status of this tribunal, which was an interference in the fair dispensation of justice\". He had asked NGT to take appropriate action against Ravi Shankar for making the statements which \"on the face of it, scandalises/tends to scandalise and interferes/tends to interfere with the free and fair dispensation of justice by the apex green tribunal. \"The NGT had earlier termed as \"shocking\" the charge levelled by Ravi Shankar and the AOL against the government and the green panel for the damage to the Yamuna floodplains, saying they had \"no sense of responsibility\". An expert committee had told the NGT that a whopping Rs 42. 02 crore would be required to restore the floodplains which was ravaged due to the cultural extravaganza last year. The expert panel had suggested that there would be two components of rehabilitation plan \u2014 physical and biological, which would cost Rs 28. 73 crore and Rs l3. 29 crore respectively, besides additional ancillary expenses. The AOL had alleged that the findings of the panel were \"biased\" and made allegations against Prof CR Babu, a member of the expert panel which had quantified the damage to the floodplains. \"The Art of Living is a responsible and environment-sensitive NGO. We have never caused any damage to the environment but have in fact worked for preserving and reviving it through various environment-related projects over the years,\" it had said.

He was 70. \"He passed away at 11. 20am. It's a sad moment for us. . . We request you all (media) for privacy,\" the actor's brother Pramod Khanna said. Khanna was admitted to the Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital on March 31 with complications arising out of severe dehydration. Pay your tributes to Vinod Khanna An official statement from the hospital said Khanna was suffering from bladder cancer.

The actor is survived by his wife, Kavita Khanna, and four children - Rahul, Akshaye, Sakshi, and Shraddha. Rahul and Akshaye, both actors, were from his first wife, Geetanjali. Feted as one of the most handsome actors of the Hindi film industry, Khanna made his acting debut in 1968 with \"Man Ka Meet\". In many of the earlier films, Khanna played a negative or a supporting role. His potential was first noticed in Gulzar's \"Mere Apne\" in 1971. A much sought after actor in the 1970s and 1980s, he acted in several blockbusters, including \"Mera Gaon Mera Desh\", \"Reshma Aur Shera\", \"Elan\", \"Insaaf\" and \"Dayavan\".

The meeting, which was attended by nearly all the MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party, saw the AAP brass introspecting on the defeat in MCD election and chalking out the future path for the party. The party seems to be changing tack on the electronic voting machine (EVM) controversy with its MLAs choosing not to speak on the subject. NO COMMENTS ON EVMsIf sources are to be believed, AAP leadership, during the meeting, accepted that EVMs were not the only reason for the party's dismal performance in the MCD election. Nearly 50 per cent of the party's MLAs are believed to have told the leadership that they were prepared for a loss in the MCD election and do not doubt EVMs. Following the party meet, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Jagdeep Singh said, \"If we find anything concrete on EVMs, we will talk about it\". Similarly, Avtar Singh, who is the AAP legislator from Kalkaji, did not comment on EVMs. On Wednesday, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal refrained from speaking on electronic voting machines (EVMs) after the MCD election result. Kejriwal took to Twitter to congratulate the BJP for winning all the three municipal corporations in Delhi. \"I congratulate BJP on their victory in all 3 MCDs. My government looks forward to working with MCDs for the betterment of Delhi,\" Arvind Kejriwal said. A DIVIDED HOUSEAfter the MCD election result came out on Wednesday, the Aam Aadmi Party, which rode to power in Delhi in 2015, was a divided house on the subject of EVM tampering. While leaders like Gopal Rai and Manish Sisodia put the blame of AAP losing the MCD election to EVM tampering, others like Kapil Mishra called for introspection. \"This is the time to introspect why we had to see this day after two years. . . The results cannot be viewed only by blaming the EVMs,\" Kapil Mishra said. Kapil Mishra admitted that a \"BJP wave\" existed. This was in contrast to AAP leader Gopal Rai saying there is \"no Modi wave\" but \"EVM wave\" in Delhi. Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann slammed the AAP leadership for behaving like \"a mohalla cricket team\" and said there was no use finding fault with EVMs. COURSE CORRECTIONWitnessing one electoral setback after the other, the Aam Aadmi Party is in need of a course-correction. As the results of the MCD election have shown, the EVM tampering controversy has failed to cut ice with voters who are more interested in their leaders talking about issues such as health and sanitation. Many experts blamed the AAP's negative campaign on EVMs as one of the reasons for its electoral loss in Delhi. The Aam Aadmi Party is now staring at a possibility of a mid-term poll in Delhi with the Election Commission expected to soon deliver its verdict on the petition seeking disqualification of 21 AAP MLAs over 'office of profit' . With the party vote share nosediving in the MCD election, Arvind Kejriwal has little time to correct its image in the eyes of Delhi voters. Perhaps, shifting its focus from EVMs to development will help. (Inputs from Abhishek Anand and Ashutosh Mishra)ALSO READ:Whither Arvind Kejriwal's AAP?

At least three soldiers including an Army officer lost their lives in the attack on an Army camp Thursday morning. The injured soldiers were airlifted to Army's 92 Base Hospital here for treatment. Two terrorists were eliminated and combing operations were launched to ensure no untoward elements were left in the vicinity. The stone pelting began a few kilometers away from the Army camp in Kupwara where the terror attack took place at 4:30 am. The protesters were trying to disturb movement of the Army convoy by pelting stones on the security forces. The Valley has witnessed a string of violent incidents this month starting with clashes between civilians and security forces and in the run-up to the Srinagar by-polls on April 9. The People's Democratic Party (PDP)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state had on Wednesday banned 22 social networking sites and applications, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter in Kashmir on the grounds that these were being misused to fan trouble. Tension in Kashmir over the past few months has escalated immensely and several terror modules have been identified in the process. More than 100 soldiers have been killed in the Valley since the beginning of 2016, and the number tally has been rising rapidly as these attacks have become more frequent in recent times. Not only soldiers but the number of civilian causalities in the region has also witnessed a sharp rise after the sentiment of dissent among the people of the region increased last year. Driven by separatist, a large section of the people residing in the Valley resorted to protests against the army after popular Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani was encountered last year. This led to a sharp escalation of tension in the region, fuelled by stone-pelting by the residents. When the army retaliated with pellets, several innocents suffered permanent injuries and a large number of people succumbed to injuries. When the first by-polls were attempted in the Valley earlier this month, there was a large-scale violence in specific regions, with Anantnag witnessing violence and bloodshed. More than three hundred people suffered injuries and around eight men were killed in the middle of retaliatory gunfire and stone-pelting. The Mehbooba Mufti government has made several attempts to scale down the violence in the terror-trotted Valley, but has failed miserably. Yet the soldiers and the civilians in the region continue to be victims of major attacks originating from across the border. This attack comes days after Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had a discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh to improve the situation in the Valley.
