Pursuing Kolkata Knight Riders' lowly total of 131 on Sunday, RCB, boasting the star troika of Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle, were floored for 49 all out in 9. 4 overs \u2013 IPL's lowest ever total, and lost the match by 82 runs at the Eden Gardens. Gujarat Lions, led by Suresh Raina take on Virat Kohli's RCB at the M Chinnaswamy stadium, SportzpicsThis was followed by a rain-enforced abadonement of the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. It meant that RCB, sitting at the sixth spot with five points, will now have to win most of their remaining matches in order to stay in the hunt for the knock-outs. This will be the golden opportunity for the hosts to take two crucial points as bottom-placed Gujarat too have had a poor run so far in the cash-rich Twenty20 cricket tournament. Out of seven matches, Gujarat have managed to win only two. Comprising star-studded batting line-up, Bangalore will have an upper hand in the fixture. The home batsmen will be on their guard against Gujarat's bowlers, though the visitors lack experience and class in that department. But in order to tame the visitors, RCB bowlers Samuel Badree, Yuzvendra Chahal, Sreenath Aravind, Tymal Mills and Adam Milne will need to raise their game. Gujarat, on the other hand, will be banking on their Australian pacer Andrew Tye, who has taken nine wickets in four games, including a hat-trick, at a decent economy rate of 8. 00. Kerala youngster Basil Thampi's ability to bowl yorkers at will has been an advantage for the Gujarat side. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is yet to fire, having taken only one wicket in the five matches so far, while veteran Praveen Kumar's lack of pace and swing has meant he has been hit at an economy rate of 10. 32 over five games. It would also be interesting to see if Irfan Pathan, who was roped in as a replacement for injured all-rounder Dwayne Bravo would be included in the playing XI. The only positive for the Gujarat outfit is the former New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum with 264 runs and Suresh Raina with 272 runs are among the top five run-getters in the tournament so far.

The work of any filmmaker is to stitch a narrative around them. And the imagination of a great filmmaker is to breathe life into them to keep the audiences riveted to screen. SS Rajamouli is no less. He had the audacity to imagine such a magnum opus that finding symbols and meanings attached to them becomes rather easy. Here are some symbols that you must not have missed in Baahubali: The Beginning, but needed further exploration:Shivudu\u2019s lifting of Shiva LingaWhen Shivudu lifts the Shiva linga on his shoulders and walks among people of his tribe, playing the \u201cJata kataha sambhramabrama nilimpa nirjari\u2026\u201d in the background, the blasphemous act not only becomes a tribute to Lord Shiva, but also tells that he alone is the man who is destined for greatness, and it is the time for him to throw off the shackles of his mother\u2019s affection and embark on a journey of greatness. Inauguration of the statue of Bhallala Deva:Like any dictator, Bhallala Deva installs his own statue and organises the biggest ever function. And at this opportune time, when the evil king wants to make his presence felt, the rightful heir arrives and gives a jolt to the state. The mighty state represented by the 100 feet golden statue becomes a dud in front or the cosmic presence of Baahubali\u2019s altruistic state. The sword of Baahubali:The menacing sword of Baahubali, which has passed through generations, represents the baton of power that would ultimately have an inheritor. At one point when Katappa gets emotional about his King, he would touch the sword to his forehead to feel his presence. It is no coincidence that Shivudu wields the same sword, as his kills son of Bhallala Deva, before Katappa rushes to bow down to the arrival of new King. Why Bhallala Deva is represented by a lion:If all symbols attached to Baahubali are horse faced \u2014 symbol on his armour and head of the sword \u2014 Bhalala Dev brings symbolism of lion to speak volumes of his character, ruthlessness and his methods to establish power with no conscience. In the epic the battle between Mahishmati and Kalakeyas, he rides on a lion-faced chariot and tramples on the everybody indiscriminately. However, Baahubali takes shine off Bhalala Deva when he kills the Kalakeya king with the lion face, and here is the time when Bhallala Dev is robbed of his power. In Baahubali: The Conclusion, we will witness many things, and among them, the coming back of these symbols will make it more impactful and leave an impression of a lifetime.
